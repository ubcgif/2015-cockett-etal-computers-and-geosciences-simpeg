@misc{HeagySEG2014,
abstract = {SummaryHydraulic fracturing is an important technique to allow mobilization of hydrocarbons in tight reservoirs. Sand or ceramic proppant is pumped into the fractured reservoir to ensure fractures remain open and permeable after the hydraulic treatment. As such, the distribution of proppant is a controlling factor on where the reservoir is permeable and can be effectively drained. Methods to monitor the fracturing process, such as tiltmeters or microseismic, are not sensitive to proppant distributions in the subsurface after the fracturing treatment is complete (Cipolla and Wright, 2000).An electrically conductive proppant could create a significant physical property contrast between the propped region of the reservoir and the host rock. Electromagnetic geophysical methods can be used to image this property (Heagy and Oldenburg, 2013). However, traditional geophysical inversions are poorly constrained, requiring a-priori information to be incorporated through known electrical properties. We examine a strategy to invert directly for the proppant volume using a parametrization of electrical conductivity in terms of proppant distribution within the reservoir.},

%% large scale inverse problem

@article{Yang2014,
abstract = {Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods are highly efficient tools for assessing the Earth's conductivity structures in a large area at low cost. However, the configuration of AEM measurements, which typically have widely distributed transmitter-receiver pairs, makes the rigorous modelling and interpretation extremely time-consuming in 3-D. Excessive overcomputing can occur when working on a large mesh covering the entire survey area and inverting all soundings in the data set. We propose two improvements. The first is to use a locally optimized mesh for each AEM sounding for the forward modelling and calculation of sensitivity. This dedicated local mesh is small with fine cells near the sounding location and coarse cells far away in accordance with EM diffusion and the geometric decay of the signals. Once the forward problem is solved on the local meshes, the sensitivity for the inversion on the global mesh is available through quick interpolation. Using local meshes for AEM forward modelling avoids unnecessary computing on fine cells on a global mesh that are far away from the sounding location. Since local meshes are highly independent, the forward modelling can be efficiently parallelized over an array of processors. The second improvement is random and dynamic down-sampling of the soundings. Each inversion iteration only uses a random subset of the soundings, and the subset is reselected for every iteration. The number of soundings in the random subset, determined by an adaptive algorithm, is tied to the degree of model regularization. This minimizes the overcomputing caused by working with redundant soundings. Our methods are compared against conventional methods and tested with a synthetic example. We also invert a field data set that was previously considered to be too large to be practically inverted in 3-D. These examples show that our methodology can dramatically reduce the processing time of 3-D inversion to a practical level without losing resolution. Any existing modelling technique can be included into our framework of mesh decoupling and adaptive sampling to accelerate large-scale 3-D EM inversions. },

@article{Haber2014,
abstract = {Airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys are effective tools for mineral exploration and geologic mapping. 3D inversion of airborne electromagnetic data is a challenging computational problem. The size of the surveys and the spatial resolution required to adequately discretize the transmitters and receivers results in very large meshes. Solving the forward problem repeatedly on such a mesh can quickly become impractical. Fortunately, using a single mesh for both the forward and inverse problem for all of the transmitters is not necessary. The forward problem for a single source or a small group of sources can be solved on different meshes, each of which only needs to be locally refined close to the selected transmitters and receivers. Away from the selected transmitters and receivers, the mesh can be coarsened. The forward problem can then be broken into a number of highly parallel problems. Each forward modelling mesh is optimized specifically to the selected transmitters and receivers and has far fewer cells than the fine inversion mesh. Further efficiency can be gained by using stochastic Gauss–Newton methods where a stochastic approximation to the gradient, Hessian or both are used. In this paper, we present new algorithms for airborne data inversion and their implementation using a finite volume discretization on OcTree meshes. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale synthetic versatile time-domain electromagnetic surveying data set.},

abstract = {Two automatic ways of estimating the regularization parameter in underdetermined, minimum-structure-type solutions to non-linear inverse problems are compared: the generalized cross-validation and L-curve criteria. Both criteria provide a means of estimating the regularization parameter when only the relative sizes of the measurement uncertainties in a set of observations are known. The criteria, which are established components of linear inverse theory, are applied to the linearized inverse problem at each iteration in a typical iterative, linearized solution to the non-linear problem. The particular inverse problem considered here is the simultaneous inversion of electromagnetic loop–loop data for 1-D models of both electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. The performance of each criteria is illustrated with inversions of a variety of synthetic and field data sets. In the great majority of examples tested, both criteria successfully determined suitable values of the regularization parameter, and hence credible models of the subsurface. },

@article{Kang2015,
abstract = {In this study, we revisit three airborne EM surveys over Tli Kwi Cho (TKC). These consist of a frequency domain DIGHEM data set, and two time domain surveys, VTEM and AeroTEM. Negative transients have been recorded in both of the time domain surveys and we interpret these as arising from chargeable bodies. The kimberlite pipes are referred to as DO-27 and DO-18. We look in more detail at the transient data and apply the ATEM-IP inversion procedure to recover a 3D pseudo-chargeability distribution. Important components of the analysis involve estimating a background conductivity for the region. For DO-27 we have used a 3D parametric inversion to recover the conductivity from TEM data. The IP signal for the inversion is obtained by subtracting the time domain responses estimated by EM inversion from the observed background signal. This process also removes EM coupling noise that might be contaminating the data. The resultant IP data are inverted with a linear inverse approach using the sensitivity from the background conductivity. This yields a 3D model of pseudo-chargeability.},

abstract = {We propose a methodology to generate a 3D distribution of pseudo-chargeability from airborne time domain electromagnetic data. The processing flow is as follows: (a) Apply 3D inversion to TEM data to restore a background conductivity. This might involve omitting responses that are obviously contaminated with IP signals, such as negative transients in coincident loop surveys. The recovered background conductivity is assumed to be uncontaminated by IP signals. (b) Compute the TEM response from the background conductivity and subtract it from the observations. This yields the dIP data, and reduces the EM coupling. (c) The background conductivity is likely not exactly the earth conductivity, but we assume that the major effects of this inaccuracy will lead to a large scale, smoothly varying perturbation to the dIP data. If this correct, then these can be recognized and removed. (d) The final data are linearly related to a pseudo-chargeability through a sensitivity function that is analogous to that employed in usual DC-IP ground surveys. (e) The dIP data at various time channels can be inverted individually. The pseudo-chargeability models may be useful in themselves or they may be further processed to estimate Cole-Cole, or equivalent, parameters. We demonstrate our procedure on a field data set from Mt. Milligan. In the field example, we identify chargeable targets that show no indication of negative transients in the raw data. From the images we can make inferences about the relative strength and geometries of the chargeable bodies.},

%% large scale inverse problem

@article{Yang2014,
  abstract = {Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods are highly efficient tools for assessing the Earth's conductivity structures in a large area at low cost. However, the configuration of AEM measurements, which typically have widely distributed transmitter-receiver pairs, makes the rigorous modelling and interpretation extremely time-consuming in 3-D. Excessive overcomputing can occur when working on a large mesh covering the entire survey area and inverting all soundings in the data set. We propose two improvements. The first is to use a locally optimized mesh for each AEM sounding for the forward modelling and calculation of sensitivity. This dedicated local mesh is small with fine cells near the sounding location and coarse cells far away in accordance with EM diffusion and the geometric decay of the signals. Once the forward problem is solved on the local meshes, the sensitivity for the inversion on the global mesh is available through quick interpolation. Using local meshes for AEM forward modelling avoids unnecessary computing on fine cells on a global mesh that are far away from the sounding location. Since local meshes are highly independent, the forward modelling can be efficiently parallelized over an array of processors. The second improvement is random and dynamic down-sampling of the soundings. Each inversion iteration only uses a random subset of the soundings, and the subset is reselected for every iteration. The number of soundings in the random subset, determined by an adaptive algorithm, is tied to the degree of model regularization. This minimizes the overcomputing caused by working with redundant soundings. Our methods are compared against conventional methods and tested with a synthetic example. We also invert a field data set that was previously considered to be too large to be practically inverted in 3-D. These examples show that our methodology can dramatically reduce the processing time of 3-D inversion to a practical level without losing resolution. Any existing modelling technique can be included into our framework of mesh decoupling and adaptive sampling to accelerate large-scale 3-D EM inversions. },

@article{Haber2014,
  abstract = {Airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys are effective tools for mineral exploration and geologic mapping. 3D inversion of airborne electromagnetic data is a challenging computational problem. The size of the surveys and the spatial resolution required to adequately discretize the transmitters and receivers results in very large meshes. Solving the forward problem repeatedly on such a mesh can quickly become impractical. Fortunately, using a single mesh for both the forward and inverse problem for all of the transmitters is not necessary. The forward problem for a single source or a small group of sources can be solved on different meshes, each of which only needs to be locally refined close to the selected transmitters and receivers. Away from the selected transmitters and receivers, the mesh can be coarsened. The forward problem can then be broken into a number of highly parallel problems. Each forward modelling mesh is optimized specifically to the selected transmitters and receivers and has far fewer cells than the fine inversion mesh. Further efficiency can be gained by using stochastic Gauss–Newton methods where a stochastic approximation to the gradient, Hessian or both are used. In this paper, we present new algorithms for airborne data inversion and their implementation using a finite volume discretization on OcTree meshes. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale synthetic versatile time-domain electromagnetic surveying data set.},

  abstract = {Two automatic ways of estimating the regularization parameter in underdetermined, minimum-structure-type solutions to non-linear inverse problems are compared: the generalized cross-validation and L-curve criteria. Both criteria provide a means of estimating the regularization parameter when only the relative sizes of the measurement uncertainties in a set of observations are known. The criteria, which are established components of linear inverse theory, are applied to the linearized inverse problem at each iteration in a typical iterative, linearized solution to the non-linear problem. The particular inverse problem considered here is the simultaneous inversion of electromagnetic loop–loop data for 1-D models of both electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. The performance of each criteria is illustrated with inversions of a variety of synthetic and field data sets. In the great majority of examples tested, both criteria successfully determined suitable values of the regularization parameter, and hence credible models of the subsurface. },
